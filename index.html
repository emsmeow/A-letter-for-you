            <h1>Hi, Nami</h1>
            <p>I've been thinking about you a lot lately, and I wanted to tell you how I feel. This might be a bit cringe, but liking you made me do it, so here goes nothing. 
                I like you, Nami. You are someone precious that I can't seem to let go of. Since we started talking and playing together on September 3, 2024, I've liked you ever since.
                Knowing you for just two weeks and four days gives me the courage to confess and make things clear. I know it's only been a short time, but my feelings for you are real. I believe in everything or nothing, 
                so I'll keep giving my all.
            </p>
                
            <p>And given the looks and glam you have, who wouldn't fall? I know, it is a stupid thing to tell but you always amaze me with the beauty you portray. 
                It is not like the other ones, your beauty is something I would never get tired of. You're like a petal of red rose in a windy weather with an aroma of coffee blending with the sea. The petal that could last long, the only petal that stays still.
                I know that I am not the best, but I am willing to be the best for you. 
            </p>

            <p>You're a mystery, Nami. You always makes me curious about what and how you do things. I don''t know, curiosity is scary but thanks to that, curiosity made me grew an interest about you.
                Don't be confused, I am interested and I like you at the same time. Maybe it is a little complicated but it is true.
            </p>

            <p>So, I will ask you, Nami. May I court you? Don't feel pressured by the things I say or do, it's your decision that matters.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
